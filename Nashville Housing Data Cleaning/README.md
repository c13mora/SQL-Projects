# Data Cleaning with SQL - Nashville Housing Dataset

Data cleaning is one of the most common and important tasks while working in Data Analytics or Data Science, this is why in this project we'll be using a dataset containing housing information from the city of Nashville, USA, to practice some important data cleaning skills, essential to sucessfully prepare data for future analysis or visualizations.

Some of the steps applied in this project were: 
- Imputation of null values in a particular column.
- Breaking down columns into several, individual columns.
- Removing duplicated data.
- Renaming columns and removal of unnecesary columns.

In this repository I provide:
- A CSV file of the dataset used in the project.
- The SQL script.
- A brief jupyter notebook with the code for loading the CSV file in an SQL database.

*Note: the database engine used in the project was PostgreSQL.*
