# Analyzing Worlwide Covid Data with SQL

Link to the data: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

- The database engine used in this project was PostgreSQL.
- I added a jupyter notebook file ('import_covid_tables_copy') with a brief code to load the csv files into PostgreSQL.
- I divided the file available in the previous link into two tables: covid_deaths, and covid_vaccinations, for ease of use. You can choose to work this way or use the whole table as it comes from the source.
